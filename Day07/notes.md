üìÖ Day 7 ‚Äì COUNT, MIN, MAX in SQL
üîπ Overview

Aggregate functions in SQL are used to perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single summary value.
Today‚Äôs focus: COUNT, MIN, MAX.

1Ô∏è‚É£ COUNT

Purpose: Returns the number of rows that match a condition.
Syntax:

SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name;

Example:

SELECT COUNT(employee_id) AS total_employees
FROM employees;

Note:

COUNT(*) ‚Üí counts all rows, including NULLs.
COUNT(column_name) ‚Üí counts only non-NULL values.

2Ô∏è‚É£ MIN

Purpose: Returns the smallest value in a column.
Syntax:

SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name;

Example:

SELECT MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary
FROM employees;

Note:
Works only with comparable data types (numbers, dates, text in lexicographic order).

3Ô∏è‚É£ MAX

Purpose: Returns the largest value in a column.
Syntax:

SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name;

Example:

SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees;

üí° Interview Tips

COUNT vs COUNT(*) vs COUNT(column)
COUNT(*): Counts all rows.
COUNT(column): Ignores NULL values.

Performance:
COUNT(*) is optimized internally in most SQL engines.
MIN/MAX with Text:
Returns alphabetically smallest/largest when used on strings.
Combining with GROUP BY:
Common in real scenarios to find min/max/count per category.

SELECT department, MAX(salary), MIN(salary), COUNT(*) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;


‚úÖ Key Takeaways:

COUNT ‚Üí How many?
MIN ‚Üí Smallest value
MAX ‚Üí Largest value

Often paired with GROUP BY for category-wise summaries
