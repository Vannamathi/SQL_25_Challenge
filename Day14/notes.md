# Day 14 â€“ FULL JOIN  

## ðŸ“Œ Notes on FULL JOIN  
- **Definition**:  
  FULL JOIN returns **all records** when there is a match in either the left or right table.  
  - If rows donâ€™t have a match, NULL values are shown.  

- **Key Point in MySQL**:  
  - MySQL does **not support FULL JOIN directly**.  
  - To achieve FULL JOIN in MySQL, we combine **LEFT JOIN + RIGHT JOIN** using `UNION`.  

- **Insights**:  
  1. FULL JOIN is useful for combining all data from two tables, even if some records donâ€™t match.  
  2. Helps in **data completeness**, showing matched + unmatched rows.  
  3. MySQL Workbench requires a workaround using **UNION**.
