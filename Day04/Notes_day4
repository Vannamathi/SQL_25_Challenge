 🔍 Topic: DISTINCT & LIMIT

-- Get unique departments 😎 
SELECT DISTINCT department 
FROM employees;

-- Get first 5 employees 😎 
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
LIMIT 5;

🧠 Explanation:
DISTINCT → Removes duplicate values from the result set and returns only unique entries. This is useful when you want to see a clean list without repetitions.

LIMIT → Controls how many rows are shown. Ideal for previewing a small portion of large tables without loading everything.

These two commands are often used together to quickly review unique data samples from large datasets.
