# 📘 Day 13 – RIGHT JOIN in SQL

## 📝 Notes
- RIGHT JOIN returns **all records from the RIGHT table** and the **matching records from the LEFT table**.  
- If there’s no match, NULL is returned for columns from the LEFT table.  
- It is the reverse of LEFT JOIN.  
- Useful when you want to see **all entries from the second table** even if they don’t have matches in the first table.

## 💡 Easiest Way to Remember
👉 Think: **RIGHT JOIN = “Keep everything from the RIGHT table.”**  
- LEFT JOIN = keep all rows from left  
- RIGHT JOIN = keep all rows from right  

🔑 Trick: Imagine **LEFT and RIGHT as "sides of importance"** → whichever side you mention in the JOIN keyword will always be fully included.
