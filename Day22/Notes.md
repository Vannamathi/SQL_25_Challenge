# Day 22 â€“ SQL CTEs (WITH Clause)

## ðŸ“Œ What is a CTE?

**CTE (Common Table Expression):**  
A temporary, named result set in SQL defined using the `WITH` clause.  
It allows you to **break complex queries into simpler, readable, and reusable steps**.

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use CTEs?

- Improve **readability** of complex queries.  
- Make queries **modular** and easier to debug.  
- Can be **referenced multiple times** in the main query.  
- Useful for **intermediate calculations** and **recursive queries**.

## ðŸ›  ðŸ’¼ Interview Tips

â˜… Explain your choice: Always clarify why you chose a CTE over a subqueryâ€”highlight readability, modularity, and maintainability.
â˜… Be ready for recursive CTEs: Some interviews may ask you to traverse hierarchies or trees using recursion.
â˜… Demonstrate structured thinking: Writing clean CTEs shows interviewers you can handle complex data transformations systematically.
â˜… Highlight efficiency: While CTEs improve readability, mention their impact on performance in large datasets if relevant.
