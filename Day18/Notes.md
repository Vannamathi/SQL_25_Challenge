# Day 18 – CASE Statements in SQL  

## 📌 Overview  
The `CASE` statement in SQL allows you to add conditional logic directly inside your queries. It’s extremely useful when you want to **categorize data, assign labels, or transform values** based on conditions.  

Instead of just returning raw values, you can make your queries **more meaningful and business-friendly** with CASE.
