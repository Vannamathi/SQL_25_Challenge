These are some of the most frequently asked queries in SQL interviews.

## 📝 Logic
- **For Nth highest salary → N − 1 salaries should be greater.**  
  Example: For the **3rd highest**, there should be **2** salaries greater than it.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
- Interview questions often test **logical thinking** rather than just syntax.  
- Use **subqueries** and **aggregate functions** smartly to solve ranking, duplicate-detection, and comparison queries.  
- Understand both:
  - **Analytical approaches** (COUNT, GROUP BY, HAVING, subqueries) and  
  - **Shortcut approaches** (LIMIT, OFFSET, window functions).
