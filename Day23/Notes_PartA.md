# ðŸš€ Day 23 â€“ Interview-style Query  

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
**Find the department with the second highest average salary.**  

This type of query is common in SQL interviews and tests your ability to combine multiple concepts.  

---

## âœ… Explanation

- GROUP BY dept_id â†’ Groups employees by department.
- AVG(salary) â†’ Calculates average salary for each department.
- ORDER BY avg_salary DESC â†’ Sorts departments from highest to lowest average salary.
- LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1 â†’
- LIMIT 1 â†’ Return 1 row only.
- OFFSET 1 â†’ Skip the first row (highest avg salary).
- Final result = Second highest average salary department.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

-OFFSET helps in fetching the Nth highest values.
Alternative approaches:
-Subquery method: Exclude the max and find the next max.
-Window functions: Use ROW_NUMBER, RANK, or DENSE_RANK.

## ðŸŽ¯ Interview Tips

Q1: How to find the Nth highest salary without LIMIT?
Use subqueries with MAX.

Q2: Which is better: LIMIT/OFFSET vs ROW_NUMBER()?
For large datasets, window functions are often more efficient.

Q3: What if multiple departments have the same average salary?
Use RANK() instead of LIMIT/OFFSET.
